# Neptune Plugins
These are some plugins I've made for [Neptune](https://github.com/uwu/neptune), the TIDAL client mod.

## Better Share

Install URL:
```

```

By default, TIDAL offers to share to X or Facebook. Since this selection is essentially useless, this plugin replaces them with buttons to copy links from other streaming services, which can be especially useful if you're sending a song or album to someone who doesn't use TIDAL.
